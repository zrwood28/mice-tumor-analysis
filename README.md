Statistical analysis and visualization of drug regimen testing data on mice with tumors.

## Summary
Data were summarized to gain some initial insights on our data set. Bar and pie graphs further summarized some descriptive qualities of both the drugs used and the mice subjects. The data set was further broken down to hone in on four drug regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. With these groups, the tumor volume data points were checked for any potential outliers, one of which was revealed when looking at Infubinol specfically. Additional visualization showed one mouse's tumor volume changing over time using the Capomulin regimen. Finally, a scatterplot was created to portray a potential association between a mouse's weight and the size of their tumor, which proved to be a strong correlation.
